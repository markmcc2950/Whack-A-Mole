This game can be scaled manually with the code by changing the `squareSize` value (line 23)

The larger the square size, the more Moles and Badgers you will encounter.

You gain 10 points per Mole whacked, and get a game over when you accidentally whack a Badger. The game over screen makes a smooth gradient from bright red to solid black, dynamic based on the number of squares exist on the board at that time.
